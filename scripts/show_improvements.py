CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CLOSED-LOOP TOURS:
1. **Every single day MUST be within 40-50 km** - including the final return day
2. **Plan a true loop, not out-and-back** - avoid going straight out and straight back
3. **Maximum radius calculation** - with 6 days and 40-50 km/day, you can only go about 94km from start as the crow flies
4. **Think circular/polygonal** - plan destinations that form a roughly circular or polygonal pattern around the start point
5. **Balance the loop** - ensure you're never more than 94km from home at any point

VALIDATION CHECKLIST FOR EACH DAY:
- Day 1 destination: Can you get back to home in 5 days at 40-50 km/day?
- Day 2 destination: Can you get back to home in 4 days at 40-50 km/day?
- Day 3 destination: Can you get back to home in 3 days at 40-50 km/day?
- Day 4 destination: Can you get back to home in 2 days at 40-50 km/day?
- Day 5 destination: Can you get back to home in 1 days at 40-50 km/day?
- Final day: MUST be exactly within 40-50 km of home

IMPORTANT: Every overnight location MUST be positioned such that:
(distance_from_start_km * 1.4) <= (days_remaining_to_return * max_daily_distance)
This ensures you can always get back within your daily distance constraints.
