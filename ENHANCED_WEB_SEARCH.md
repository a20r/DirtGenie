# Enhanced Web Search Integration - Weather and Accommodations

## Overview

Successfully updated the bikepacking planner's OpenAI API calls and prompts to specifically instruct the AI to use web search capabilities for finding current weather information and better accommodation options.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced System Prompts

**Planning Function (`plan_tour_itinerary`):**
- Updated system prompt to explicitly request weather forecasts and accommodation searches
- Added specific instructions to search for real, bookable accommodations with current availability and pricing
- Emphasized the need to verify all locations and services are real and currently operating

**Trip Generation Function (`generate_trip_plan`):**
- Enhanced system prompt with detailed search requirements for weather, accommodations, and local services
- Added priority instructions for weather forecasts and accommodation options
- Specified need for current contact information and operating status

### 2. Detailed Search Requirements

Both prompts now instruct the AI to search for:

**Weather Information:**
- Detailed weather forecasts for each planned location and travel dates
- Current seasonal considerations and conditions
- Temperature, precipitation, wind forecasts

**Accommodation Details:**
- Specific campgrounds, hotels, B&Bs, hostels with current availability
- Exact pricing and booking requirements
- Contact information and reservation details
- Multiple options per location (primary + backup choices)

**Additional Current Information:**
- Trail conditions, road closures, construction alerts
- Local bike shops with current hours and services
- Food sources and grocery stores with operating hours
- Water sources and refill points
- Local events, festivals, or seasonal attractions
- Recent safety concerns or route advisories
- Park permits, fees, or reservation requirements

### 3. Enhanced Output Format

**Trip Generation Output Now Includes:**
- **WEATHER SECTION**: Detailed current forecasts for each location and travel day
- **ACCOMMODATION SECTION**: Specific lodging options with current availability, pricing, and booking information
- Multiple accommodation options per location
- Packing lists adapted to current weather forecasts
- Budget estimates with current, researched pricing

### 4. JSON Format Enhancements

Updated the JSON format instructions to specify:
- "Specific accommodation name or camping area (search for real, bookable options with current availability)"
- Requirements to verify all locations are real and currently operating

## Testing

Created comprehensive test script (`test_enhanced_prompts.py`) that verifies:
- ✅ All search-related keywords are present in prompts
- ✅ Both closed-loop and point-to-point tour prompts are enhanced
- ✅ System prompts include specific weather and accommodation search instructions
- ✅ Output format prioritizes weather and accommodation information

## Impact

The bikepacking planner now provides:

1. **Current Weather Information**: Real-time forecasts for planning and packing decisions
2. **Verified Accommodations**: Real, bookable places to stay with current availability and pricing
3. **Up-to-date Trail Information**: Current conditions, closures, and safety alerts
4. **Accurate Local Services**: Current operating hours and availability of bike shops, restaurants, and supplies
5. **Seasonal Considerations**: Current information about seasonal attractions, road conditions, and service availability

This enhancement significantly improves the accuracy and usefulness of the generated trip plans by ensuring all recommendations are based on current, searchable information rather than potentially outdated training data.
